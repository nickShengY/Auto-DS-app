# Auto-DS-app

## 0. Introduction:  
Tired of coding the same "train_data", "test_data", and "scipy"/"scikit-learn" codes?   
I got you!  
Tired of coding the validation and tests scores over and over again?   
I got you!
Not familiar with certain calssifier implementation?   
I got you!  
Did you ever imagine there is a black-box tool and you can sometimes put in some datasets to fit with the state-of-art models with just a few clicks?   
Now it is the time!    
   
**Auto-DS-app** is an ensemble web based app tool to do basic machine learning modelling and data analysis. The app utilized the 'Pycaret' package and the 'streamlit' to make the machine learning tasks simple to operate and easy to understand. Streamlit and Pycaret are popular open-source data analysis packages for developers to get a general idea inside of their datasets. They provide tons of great visualization tools and machine learning models for users to fit and predict in a balck-box tool conveniently without losing the authority of making changes by providing tuning nobs.
